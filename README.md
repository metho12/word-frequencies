# Building and Visualizing word frequencies


In this lab, we will focus on the `build_freqs()` helper function and visualizing a dataset fed into it. In our goal of tweet sentiment analysis, this function will build a dictionary where we can lookup how many times a word appears in the lists of positive or negative tweets. This will be very helpful when extracting the features of the dataset in the week's programming assignment. Let's see how this function is implemented under the hood in this notebook.
